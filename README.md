# A VR Music Film Experience
This VR experience is conceived as a spatial film for an album I composed using granular synthesis. Each room corresponds to a different track, with its own arrangement of screens and continuously evolving video sequences. The viewer is not supposed to interact with or walk through the scenes, and rather enjoy the experience, as if it was a film.
